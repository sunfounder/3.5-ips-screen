**Interface Definition**

Here is the pinout diagram for the 3.5-inch IPS screen. In reality, only the first 26 pins are connected. Pins 27â€“40 are not connected; they are only there to be compatible with the current 40-pin Raspberry Pi models and to reduce the chance of incorrect insertion.

**Fan Pins**

On the back of the screen, there are two fan pins that allow you to connect an external fan. However, once the fan is connected, it will run continuously and cannot be controlled by code.
