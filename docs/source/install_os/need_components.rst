* **Power Adapter**

  Different Raspberry Pi models require different power supplies.  
  It is recommended to use the official adapter for best stability:

  * **Raspberry Pi 5**: Recommended: **5V 5A USB-C power supply** (Official 27W PSU). You may also use a USB-C Power Delivery (PD) charger, provided it can supply enough current.  

  * **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B**: Recommended: **5V 3A USB-C power supply** (Official 15W USB-C PSU). You may also use a USB-C PD or QC 2.0 fast charger.  

  * **Raspberry Pi 3B / 3B+**: Recommended: **5V 2.5A Micro-USB power supply**.  

  * **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W**: Recommended: **5V 2.5A Micro-USB power supply**.

Optional Components
------------------------

Although not strictly required, the following peripherals will greatly improve your learning and debugging experience:

* **Monitor (HDMI or TV)** 

  For beginners, we strongly recommend a display with an HDMI input, so you can easily configure Raspberry Pi OS and run graphical programs.

* **Keyboard & Mouse**

  Very useful during the initial setup of Raspberry Pi OS. Later, you may switch to remote access (SSH/VNC), but for beginners we recommend preparing a basic USB or wireless set.
