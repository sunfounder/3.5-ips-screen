Install and Set Up Operating System
===========================================

This section walks you through installing the correct operating system for your Raspberry Pi, configuring Wi-Fi, and enabling remote access so you can run your code easily.

If you’re already familiar with Raspberry Pi and can access the command line, you can skip this entire section.

.. note::

    * **Raspberry Pi OS**: The 3.5'' touchscreen is not yet supported on the Trixie system. We’re updating the driver soon.

      - If you are using a **Raspberry Pi 4 or 5**, please install the older **Bookworm** system.  
      - If you are using a **Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+ or Zero 2W**, you must install the |link_bullseye| system. 

    * For the **Retropie** system, please download the version for your Raspberry Pi (not Pi 5) from the |link_retropie|.
