#. Click **NEXT**.

   .. note::

      * For systems that cannot be configured in advance, after clicking **NEXT**, you will be prompted whether to save the data within the device. If you have confirmed that a backup has been made, select **Yes**.

      * For systems where the Hostname, WiFi, and Enable SSH can be configured in advance, a pop-up will appear prompting whether to apply the OS's custom settings. You can choose **Yes** or **No**, or go back to edit further.

   * Define a **hostname** for your Raspberry Pi. The hostname is your Raspberry Pi's network identifier. You can access your Pi using ``<hostname>.local`` or ``<hostname>.lan``.

   * Create a **Username** and **Password** for the Raspberry Pi's administrator account. Establishing a unique username and password is vital for securing your Raspberry Pi, which lacks a default password.

   * Configure the wireless LAN by providing your network's **SSID** and **Password**.

     .. note::

       Set the ``Wireless LAN country`` to the two-letter `ISO/IEC alpha2 code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements>`_ corresponding to your location.

   * To remotely connect to your Raspberry Pi, enable SSH in the Services tab.

     * For **password authentication**, use the username and password from the General tab.
     * For public-key authentication, choose "Allow public-key authentication only". If you have an RSA key, it will be used. If not, click "Run SSH-keygen" to generate a new key pair.

     .. image:: img/os_enable_ssh.png
         
   * The **Options** menu lets you configure Imager's behavior during a write, including playing sound when finished, ejecting media when finished, and enabling telemetry.
